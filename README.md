- **What is it?**
A tool that allows students to choose the courses they want to take and select the subclasses they prefer, in order to automatically generate possible timetables.

So that you don't have to bang your head against the computer trying to figure out how to fit all your courses without clashes!

- **Features**
    - Load course data downloaded from HKU's portal, or use the built-in data (may not be up-to-date).
    - Quickly search for courses by course code.
    - Ability to select subclasses you want to take for each course.
    - Ability to see who teaches each subclass (if provided).
    - Automatically generate all possible combinations of timetables based on your selected courses and subclasses.

- **How to use it?** See the following guide: [HERE](#how-to-use)

### How to use?

1. Go to [the tool's website](https://planner.jacobshing.com) on your desktop or tablet. Mobile devices are not supported.

2. Choose ONE of the following:

    - **OPTION A**: Download the latest course data from HKU's portal (RECOMMENDED)

        On [HKU portal](https://hkuportal.hku.hk/), click on the left side menu `Timetables` -> `Class Timetable` -> `Download Class Timetable (for 20XX-XX) (updated on 20YYMMDD HH:MM)`.

        You should get a file in `.xlsx` format.

        In the tool, under "Upload your own XLSX file", choose the file your just downloaded.
        The tool will start reading the file and bring you to the next step when it's done.

    - OR **OPTION B**: Use the built-in course data

        Click on the green button "Use Default Timetable".

        > [!WARNING] During course selection period, the University will update the course data frequently.
        > The built-in data may be outdated.
        > It is recommended that you download the latest data EACH TIME you use the tool.

3. On the left side, you can type in the course code to search for a course.

    Click on the course to expand it.
    You will see a list of available subclasses (sections) for that course along with the instructor names (if provided).
    Click on "All Sections" if you don't have a preference, or select the specific subclass(es) you want to enroll.

    Added courses will appear in the shopping cart on the right side.
    You can further adjust the subclass selections there, or remove the course by clicking the red cross button.

    > [!TIP] The system supports adding at most 12 courses in the same year.
    > Each semester will get up to 6 courses.
    > Full year courses (suffixed with "FY") are not supported at this time.

4. When you're done selecting courses, click on the green "Solve" button in the bottom right corner.

    The system will calculate all possible combinations of timetables based on your selections.
    If it is not possible to fit your selected courses without clashes, a red error message will appear. You can try selecting more subclasses or removing some courses.

5. On the next screen, you will see two lists on the left side, one for Semester 1 and one for Semester 2.

    Each list contains unique timetables for you to choose from.
    Click on a plan to see its calendar view on the right side.

    > [!TIP] If the plan you selected has overlapping classes with the other semester, those plans will be disabled because you cannot take the same class twice.

    > [!TIP] If your selected courses only fit in one semester, you will only see one list of plans.

6. Explore the plans and choose the one that fits all your needs, or click on "Back to Search" to modify your course selections and try again.
